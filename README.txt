GITHUB README: 

	This program is 34 years old!! And it keeps on going..

	Alan K Biocca W6AKB (Formerly WB6ZQZ) Wrote this in 1984 using small c 
	and it was titled "WB6ZQZ's Field Day Logging Program". In 2002, Mr Biocca 
	rewrote the program in Python and renamed it FDLog. That year, FDLog was 
	released as open source with the GNU License. The original FDLog is still in 
	use by the High Sierra Field Day Group and maintained by Mr Biocca at 			www.fdlog.info. 

	My name is Scott Hibbs KD4SIR. I found FDLog on the Internet and started using it
	for Field Day 2012. In love with it, I immediately started learning Python. After
	using FDLog for Field Day 2013, the South Central Indiana Communications Support
	Group (SCICSG - we pronounce it scuzzy) wanted to know their individual scores and 
	wanted a quick way to see "who" was on which bands. When our upgrades were not 
	acted on by Mr Biocca, we decided to modify the program for ourselves for 2014. 
	We have enhanced the original program 80 times now and occasionally we have and 
	will pick up some of Mr Biocca's new ideas too.  

	We hope you fall in love with the program (like we have) and can help us improve it. 
	Send suggestions, help, pull request, ideas to Scott Hibbs at gmail.com
	
	Please look in the Releaselog file to see a list of our Enhancements!

ITEMS WE ARE WORKING ON NEXT:

	Future Updates:
		* Reprint the log after an edit for clarity (turn black not stay blue)
		* Change the visitor/participant entry so the initials are not first.
		* copy/paste and up arrow (to reprint the last entry) in the program.
		* Add more scoring: 
			complex GOTA points, youth, information table, official visitors, 
			max 20 radios, power multipliers, educational activity... 
		* An Information Table node that will allow sign in, show our group score, 
			the top 5 operators, the top 5 visitors, Worked All States etc.
		* Phonetics at the bottom of the screen for our call exchange (gota too)
	Future Fixes: 
		# Dupe check for requested fills - 2 UNconnected nodes can dupe and both 			count when connected. (currently dupe checking is at entry - not on fills)
