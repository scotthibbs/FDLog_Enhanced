 2200 and 600 - meter bands

General, Advanced and Amateur Extra class licensees are authorized to use these Amateur Bands

Amateurs wishing to operate on either 2,200 or 630 meters must first register with the Utilities Technology Council online at https://utc.org/plc-database-amateur-notification-process/. You need only register once for each band.
