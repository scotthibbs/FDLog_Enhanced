General, Advanced and Amateur Extra class licensees are authorized to use these Amateur Bands

Amateurs wishing to operate on either 2,200 or 630 meters must first register with the Utilities Technology Council online at https://utc.org/plc-database-amateur-notification-process/. You need only register once for each band.

Notes:
1) Significant regional variations in both current band utilization and the intensity and frequency distribution of noise sources preclude one plan that is suitable for all parts of the country.  These variations will require many regional frequency coordinators to maintain band plans that differ in some respects from any national plan.  As with all band plans, locally coordinated plans always take precedence over any general recommendations such as a national band plan.

2) May be used for either repeater inputs or weak-signal as regional needs dictate

3) Division into channels and/or separation of uses within these segments may be done regionally based on needs and usage, such as for 2 MHz-wide digital TV.

4) These segments may also be designated regionally to accommodate alternative repeater splits.

5) Simplex FM calling frequency 927.500 or regionally selected alternative.

6) Additional FM simplex frequencies may be designated regionally.

9 cm Band Plan Notes 

Note 1 – Includes all other emission modes authorized in the 9 cm amateur band whose necessary bandwidth does not exceed the suggested bandwidths listed.

Note 2 – Weak Signal Terrestrial legacy users are encouraged to move to 3400.3 to 3401.0 MHz as time and resources permit.

Note 3 – Broadband segments may be used for any combination of high-speed data (e.g. 802.11 protocols), Amateur Television and other high-bandwidth activities.  Division into channels and/or separation of uses within these segments may be done regionally based on need and usage.

 Note 4 – Per ITU RR 5.149 from WRC-07, these band segments are also used for Radio Astronomy.  Amateur use of these frequencies should be first coordinated with the National Science Foundation (esm@nsf.gov).
