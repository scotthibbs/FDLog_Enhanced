2005 Notes

For the last couple of years we have used an access point. This works very well.
It is good to have a backup access point in case of equipment failure. Some
access points don't work right when not connected to the internet. Check this out
in advance.

Wireless Configuration

Choosing Peer to Peer versus an Access Point is a subject of some debate. The Peer
to Peer solution is nice in that there is minimal hardware required (no access point),
no power required for the access point, and no single point of failure. This is
traded for more configuration complexity. Some wireless cards and software versions
do not do peer to peer correctly. If you choose to use peer to peer then certainly
a pre-FD test event is important to weed out the problems. If you choose to use an
access point then make sure you have a spare and have figured out how to power it.
Also, configuring the access point can be problematic, so testing is indicated here
as well.

Ad-Hoc (peer to peer)
  Channel 10 (arbitrary, all use same)
  net name 'fdnet'
  select peer-to-peer or ad-hoc
  encryption/wep off

Access Point
  if we have one then select that mode instead
  and use DHCP if possible

Host Name
  hosts require unique node id
  recommend <callsign>-<number> (or your choice)
    or suffix-digit
    eg wb6w, wb6w-1, wb6w-2, zqz-1
  8 chars max, lowercase letters, numbers, - (hyphen)



IP addresses (only if DHCP not used)

  set fixed address, netmask

  netmask        255.0.0.0

  default route  10.0.0.1

  NTP server     10.0.0.5   time server

                            range of 10 addresses each, xx0..xx9

  Alan    wb6zqz 10.0.0.10  fdlog prog web server
  Eric    wd6cmu 10.0.0.20

Is it working?
  Check Signal Strength
  ping other stations


Download Software
  use internet explorer or netscape
    http://10.0.0.10/
      python
      fdlog.zip
      autochron.zip NTP client (optional)


Install NTP Client (optional)
  config
    server, set time every 200 seconds
  run
  check clock
  check time zone!


Install Python


Put FDLOG zip in a directory and unzip it
  d:\fdlog


run fdlog.py
  double click on fdlog.py
  set station id: (answer question)
    (if GOTA station: set station id: .station gota)

  set authentication key   (see Alan(wb6zqz) for key of the day)
                                  or use practice key "tst"
