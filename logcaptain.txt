In a Nutshell:
    A participant is everyone.
	The Contestant is the one making contacts.
	The Logger is the one entering data.
	One of them needs to have a license.
	If you see red, select something.
	Bands are vertical. Modes are horizontal.
	The modes are (C)ode, (D)igital, and (P)hone.
	-Call-Class-Sect- is separated by spaces.
	An example is kd4sir 1d ky <Enter>
	Don't hit enter until after the contact is made.
	Without "QSL - May I have another?" it didn't work.
	Hit <Escape> to start over.
	You can use the up arrow to retype the last contact.
	You can now copy/past full entries.
	Type ? for help.


COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS: (I've never used them but you might)

	You can run FDLog_Enhanced with command-line arguments to skip the
	interactive prompts. This is useful for scripting and automation.

	Usage: python FDLog_Enhanced.py [--node NAME] [--auth KEY]

	Options:
	  --node, -n    Station node name (7 chars, e.g., station1, station2, gota)
	  --auth, -a    Authentication key (e.g., 24 for year 2024, or tst for testing)
	  --help, -h    Show help message

	Examples:
	  python FDLog_Enhanced.py                        # Interactive mode
	  python FDLog_Enhanced.py --node station1 --auth 24   # CLI mode
	  python FDLog_Enhanced.py -n gota -a 24          # GOTA station (short form)

	Notes:
	- All nodes must use the same --auth key to communicate on the network
	- Node names are padded to 8 characters with random letters for uniqueness
	- If options are not provided, you will be prompted interactively


SHORT HISTORY AND INTRODUCTION:

	This program is 40+ years old!!

	Alan K Biocca W6AKB (Formerly WB6ZQZ) Wrote this in 1984 using small c
	and it was titled "WB6ZQZ's Field Day Logging Program". In 2002, Mr Biocca
	rewrote the program in Python and renamed it FDLog. That year, FDLog was
	released as open source with the GNU License. FDLog is still in use by the High Sierra
	Field Day Group and maintained by Mr Biocca at www.fdlog.info.

	My name is Scott Hibbs KD4SIR. I found FDLog on the Internet and started using it
	for Field Day 2012. After using FDLog for Field Day 2013, the South Central Indiana
	Communications Support Group (SCICSG - we pronounce it scuzzy) wanted to know their
	individual scores and wanted a better way to see who was on what bands. When our
	upgrades were not acted on, we decided to modify the program for ourselves for 2014.
	It was eventually renamed FDLog_Enhanced and made a repository on www.github.com.
	We have enhanced the original program and occasionally will pick up some of Mr Biocca's
	new ideas too.

	We hope you fall in love with the program (like we have) and can help us improve it.


WHY LOVE FDLOG_ENHANCED?:

	Simply, "It is a free networked logging program with a distributed database." If you
	need more let me explain. Since it is networked, everyone can see the band and mode you
	are on. Since the data is distributed, your contacts get sent to all the other users
	in real time. No one can dupe and non-dupe contacts are displayed as you log. You can
	send messages to all users. You can see how many contacts you have made, how many contacts
	you have logged and see the combined phone and digital and CW contacts for the group. It tracks
	who is the control operator (logger) for non-hams (as Contestant). 
	
	The GOTA station log is maintained WITH the regular log without conflicting with dupes. 
	This allows GOTA to get previous contacts with other users, and allows everyone to 
	know which band and mode everyone is using. 
	
	The INFO Node should be set up at the information desk or in a public area to show the 
	current score and allow visitors to sign in to the program. 

	The greatest thing is how it is not dependant on one computer! A computer can go down, bad
	crash - like Zed is dead baby - and Field Day goes on. Add a new computer to
	the network and all the other computers will catch the new one up very quickly.

	Because it is Python 3, all you need is a PC - Linux, Mac, any Windoze, RaspberryPi -
	we don't care - doesn't matter.

	If I didn't HAVE you when I said, "free", "Zed is dead", and "I really don't care what
	kind you have", maybe this program isn't for you. :)


PROGRAM SETUP:

	So you are the ham and or computer guru in charge of logging Field Day..
	Here's all you have to do.

	Before Field Day:

	Find a router to bring to field day. I set the SSID to "Field Day" and
	leave it open without a password. This will be what everyone will connect
	to on field day. Test it to make sure it works. And don't leave it home.
	I've had to buy cheap routers the morning of - I got a collection.

	Building the executables:
	Use build.py to build the executables. This needs to be ran on all the 
	computer types (mac, linux, PC). 
	
	reset.py: This allows you to play with the program and asks to delete the
	log files and rebuild the executable if changes are made. You may want to 
	remove this file from your zip if you are worried someone will run it. 
	
	INTERNET:
	Internet is prefered onsite for NTP servers and building the executables.
	The program works without the internet available, but the INTERNET IS REQUIRED
	TO BUILD THE EXECUTABLES FOR EACH TYPE (PC, MAC AND LINUX). 
	
	WITHOUT INTERNET: 
	If you don't have internet at your site, then you need these executables made before
	going onsite.

	With a USB flash drive:
		You will need the program folder with the pre-built executables. 
		Move the files to the new machine to install.
	Without a USB flash drive:
		When you start the first machine on field day, the last set up question will ask
		if you want to distribute the program. Say yes if you need to. If you already have 
		a zip file it will ask if you want to replace it. Else it creates a zip file and
		starts share_fdlog.py (can be ran separately). It will add any needed premade 
		executables if found. Go to the other machines on the network,
		browse to the webpage, download the zip and extract and build or run it.

	The setup questions should be answered by one person and answered once, the rest will say no.
	So the logging captain will do this.

	But when the program starts it will ask everyone what is the name of the node it is running.
	I suggest the name of the station or location or antenna - Something everyone will recognize
	where this node will be. This entry requires 7 digits, so letters will be added or removed
	to make this 7 digits. Everyone must use the same "auth" code which should be the last two
	digits of the contest year like 27. Next it will ask if you need to set up for Field Day.
	If you are not the logging captain, say no.
	Before any contacts are made, the logging captain can change the class and section if
	needed.

	It is a good habit to check the time efore starting the program, because this program
	can not change the computer's clock. Time is important to this program because the database
	is shared.

	At Field Day:

	Set up the new router because you left yours at home. Also note many
	public "guest" router networks will not allow computers to talk to each other.
	Although not necessary, it is recommended to start the computer you want to be a
	designated Time Master first, set the time, Connect to the router network if wireless
	(you could also be wired). Start the program alone on the network. If you want this
	computer to be the designated time master use ".tmast me" or go to properties/Time Function
	and check This node is Time Master. If you need to change the class or other information
	you added earlier, this can be done with the .set commands found in the help menu.

	Next you want a copy of the program on every computer. Using the methods above.
	Before starting the program, set the time on the computer with your accurate time
	source within a second or two. If you forget this step, the program will spend time
	adjusting it's time to the others. Start the program and set the name and year's digits.
	Answer NO to the setup question. If connected to the network, it should see
	your time master pc and grab all it's information. Rinse and Repeat for the others.

	The port that the program uses is listed in the program's heading at the top, this
	port number does change from year to year. Make sure to allow the port it uses
	through the firewall on each machine if there is an issue.

	Before field day ends, make sure your computer is the last to be turned off.
	This is so you have the most accurate log entries in case someone is editing
	their log after the contest.

	After Field Day:

	Look through the .set menu to set any missing information. Don't forget to
	use .pr to make a "fdlog.txt" file that summarizes the contacts etc.
	Using the program's info, you can submit your results. You're a hero and
	everyone loves ya. At the recap meeting give everyone funny certificates
	such as most contacts, least contacts, most points, prettiest radio,
	and the most important one - most logged which means they helped others.
	This person should be your best friend. Ask them for ideas for me.


USING THE PROGRAM:

	Participants are everyone at Field Day. The Contestant is the person using
	the radio. The Logger is the one using the program. The Operator field caused
	my club to debate if the person was Control Operator. We made a version that
	required a license for the operator. The problem then, was that a ham & non-ham
	pair had no idea who operated the radio or logged since it could only be entered
	one way. The ham got credit for contacts while logging and the non-ham had no
	idea about the number they logged or contacted (added together). So the Radio
	Operator and Control Operator are different and confusing for this program. We
	changed the Operator name to Contestant.

	Non-hams are allowed and encouraged to operate with a Control Operator logging.
	This program has always tracked the logger. So the Operator field is renamed
	Contestant for the person at the radio. Thus, we can track the number of contacts
	or data entries logged, and keep accurate logs for everyone, even for non-hams.
	Hams can accurately know how many contacts they worked and who logged for them.
	They can also see if they logged themselves and who they logged for in turn.
	This maintains a score for contacts and a score for logging for each participant.
	The program will check for a Control Operator (license needed for Contestant or
	logger) before allowing a contact. - Scott Hibbs KD4SIR Mar/29/2017


LOGGING LIKE A PRO:

	If you are seeing red, you need to select something before trying to log
	an entry. You need to select the Contestant, the Logger, the power (natural
	does not mean a gas generator), and which band and mode you will be using.

	Entry has been straight forward since 1984. That's before pretty pictures.
	Enter the call and hit <space>. If this is a dupe it will show all the entries
	for that call and be erased. If the call has been worked on a different band
	those will populate and the call will remain for more entry. Next enter the
	Class and the Section. Once confirmed hit enter to add this entry to the log.

	If you're feeling fancy: You can also just enter the suffix and hit space.
	It will show you those who might have been worked with that suffix on this
	band. If correct continue with the Class and Section. If incorrect type the
	correct prefix and hit space. Then continue with the call and Section. Hit
	Enter to add the call to the log.

	Many times the logging program will think you are getting fancy and try to be
	fancy itself. If either of you are confused, just hit Escape to clear the
	entry and start over - try not to get too fancy.

	The up arrow will recall an entry previously typed before.

	Complete contacts like "kd4sir 1d IN" can be now copy or pasted into the entry window.

	Unless you see "QSL! May I have another!" it didn't log.


LOG CAPTAIN COMMANDS:

	As the Log Captain you are the admin of the event. You answer the setup
	questions, manage participants, handle time sync, and make sure the contest
	submission is correct when it's all over. Below are the commands and tools
	you need to run things.

	Admin PIN:

	You can set a 4-digit admin PIN to protect admin functions from other nodes.
	Use .set adminpin to open a dialog and set one. The PIN is stored as a hash
	so it can't be read back. Anyone who needs admin access will be prompted for it.

	Managing Participants:

	Each participant needs a unique set of initials. Once set, initials can not
	be changed. As Log Captain you can edit a participant's name, callsign, age,
	or title but not their initials. A participant can not be deleted if they have
	entries in the log.

	The age and visitor title fields are used to track official visitors and youth
	participants for Field Day reporting.

	Editing Log Entries:

	Click on the entry you want to edit in the log window. Entries made by your
	node are dark blue while entries from other nodes are black. You can only edit
	your own blue entries.

	Adding Entries from a Paper Log:

	Set the Contestant, Logger, power, and band/mode then type the entry with
	this format:
	:dd.hhmm <call> <class> <section>
	The timestamp uses UTC in dd.hhmm format (day.hourminute).

	Messaging:

	#<message>   Send a broadcast message (QST) to all nodes on the network.
	             Messages can be up to 40 characters.

	Status and Reports:

	.st          This station's status
	.ba          Station and band status across all nodes
	.re          Log summary report (contacts by band and mode)
	.pr          Print contest entry and log files for submission
	.h           Display the in-program help menu

	Band and Power:

	.band <bandmode>   Change your band and mode. Examples: 40p, 20c, 2d
	                   Bands: 160, 80, 40, 20, 15, 10, 6, 2, 220, 440,
	                   900, 1200, sat
	                   Modes: c (CW), d (Digital), p (Phone)
	.off               Change your band to off
	.pow <value>       Set power level. Examples: 100, 1500n (n = natural power)

	Time Master Commands:

	Time sync is critical for the distributed database. As Log Captain you will
	typically designate your main computer as the Time Master.

	.tmast             Show Time Master status and election info
	.tmast me          Set this node as the designated Time Master
	.tmast <node>      Set a specific node as designated Time Master
	.tmast clear       Remove Time Master designation and clear election state
	.tmast elect       Force a new election for auto-elected Time Master

	Time Master priority: Designated (tmast) beats Elected (telect) beats Client.
	If the designated master goes offline, the system will auto-elect a replacement.
	When the designated master returns, it automatically takes over again.

	The .set Commands (Contest Configuration):

	These commands set global values that are shared across all nodes on the
	network. Use the format: .set <parameter> <value>

	Contest and Site Information:
	  .set class <val>    FD class, e.g. 2A (max 3 chars)

	Quick Reference - Log Captain Checklist:

	Before Field Day:
	  [ ] Build executables for all platforms or prepare USB drives
	  [ ] Test router and network connectivity

	At Field Day:
	  [ ] Start your node first on the network
	  [ ] Answer YES to setup questions (everyone else says NO)
	  [ ] Set yourself as Time Master with .tmast me if this node will be your time master
	  [ ] Distribute program to other computers
	  [ ] Verify all nodes see each other (check network status)
	  [ ] Allow the program's port through each machine's firewall if needed

	After Field Day:
	  [ ] Be the last computer turned off
	  [ ] Fill in any missing .set values (bonus points, site info, etc.)
	  [ ] Run .pr to generate contest submission files
	  [ ] Submit results using the generated files


TROUBLESHOOTING:

	  A new label for FDLog_Enhanced is the Network section. This label will now
	describe your current network status with different colors. Grey shows if everything
	is OK, Yellow will ask you if there is a problem, and Red displays if there IS a problem.
	The messages in FDLog_Enhanced have been renamed to be more descriptive but the issues below
	are the same.

	Most network errors occur due to firewall issues. Please ensure the firewall isn't blocking traffic.


	  SEND FAIL  or SNDP FAIL. The error displayed in FDLog_Enhanced is
				 "SEND FAIL - Not sending data to others. (firewall?)"
				 The Packet Sender has received an error from the operating
				 system. This may occur when there is a network problem. Check the
				 firewall. Restarting the program or rebooting may cure it.

	  RCVP FAIL  In FDLog_Enhanced this is called
				"Alone? Not receiving data from others. (firewall?)" Ten seconds have
				 passed without receiving any packets. This indicates that no
				 other packets from a FDLOG program are being received within
				 the time window. This could indicate a problem with the network
				 or auth key, or it could be normal if this is the only computer
				 on this network running the program. Try restarting the program
				 after the network is known to be working.

				 * This will also flash occasionally under normal circumstances
				 if there are only two computers on the network or if there
				 is inactivity on the network in the programs.


	  AUTH FAIL  A packet has been received (on the port) that has the incorrect
				 authentication code. It will not be processed. All nodes
				 participating must use the same authentication key. This is the
				 two digit number entered when starting the program refering to
				 the year of the contest ("23").

				 Refer to the command window for more information about this error. It
				 is best if test and production modes use different ports to
				 avoid seeing each others packets which have differing
				 authentication codes.

	  NEED FILL  A node status broadcast has been received, and one or more
				 of these nodes have data that this node's database does
				 not have. This node will request the missing data until
				 it is caught up. The new database items will be displayed in
				 the upper display as they come in. If the NEED FILL is
				 indicated, and no data is flowing into the upper display,
				 the requests for data are not being answered.

	How the program handles the Time:

	Time Sync Overview

  Priority Chain (highest to lowest)
  +-----------+--------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
  | Priority  |       Source       |              How Set              |             Behavior              |
  +-----------+--------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
  | 1         | tmast (designated) | User sets via .tmast me or dialog | Always wins if online             |
  +-----------+--------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
  | 2         | telect (elected)   | Judge announces after election    | Acts as master when tmast offline |
  +-----------+--------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
  | 3         | Client             | Automatic                         | Syncs from level 0 source        |
  +-----------+--------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

  Time Levels

  - Level 0 - Time master (designated, elected, or NTP-synced)
  - Level 1-8 - Synced from a level N-1 source
  - Level 9 - Unsynchronized

  Election System

  Judge: Lowest named active node

  Election Triggers:
  - tmast set but offline, no valid telect
  - telect set but offline (and tmast still offline)
  - No tmast, no telect, no time source for 90+ seconds

  Election Process:
  1. Judge sets telect = "election" (broadcast)
  2. 10 second collection period
  3. Judge evaluates: GPS > NTP > lowest node name
  4. Judge sets telect = <winner> (broadcast)

  Winner Priority: GPS-locked > NTP-synced > Lowest node name

  Broadcast & Sync

  - Nodes broadcast status every 10 seconds (includes time level)
  - Clock update runs every 30 seconds
  - Nodes receive time via calib() and adjust via _do_client_sync()
  - Active node timeout: 60 seconds (considered offline after)

  State Transitions

  [No Master] --90s--> [Judge starts election] --10s--> [telect winner]
                                                              |
  [tmast returns] <------------ [telect defers] <-------------+
        |
        v
  [tmast leaves] --> [telect resumes automatically]
        |
  [telect also leaves] --> [New election by remaining judge]

  Key Commands
  +---------------+------------------------------------+
  |    Command    |               Action               |
  +---------------+------------------------------------+
  | .tmast        | Show full status                   |
  +---------------+------------------------------------+
  | .tmast me     | Set this node as designated master |
  +---------------+------------------------------------+
  | .tmast <node> | Set specific node as designated    |
  +---------------+------------------------------------+
  | .tmast clear  | Clear tmast and telect             |
  +---------------+------------------------------------+
  | .tmast elect  | Force new election                 |
  +---------------+------------------------------------+

  Persistence

  - tmast - Persists in log, survives restarts, never auto-cleared
  - telect - Persists in log, cleared only by new election or .tmast clear
