 56 "Add New Participant" window uses the Enter key to save.
 55 Can not edit previously EDITED log entries. 
 
2017-beta-6 (unreleased - tested)
	54 Fixed who's on the bands reporting - now nice print out (from .ba report). 
	53 Fixed freezing for the gota station.. gota is now gotanode.
	52 Changed clock slew to a bigger number (0.75931) 
	51 Class reporting should be correct now. Free VHF too. (reworked)
	50 Protected against putting the fdcall and gota call in the log. 
	49 Fixed the .node command - discovered it was broken.
	48 Updated all the documentation files. 
	47 Removed the wireless information menu - no longer needed.
	46 Removed the propagation report. (Anyone use it?)
	45 Removed duplicate arrl_sect.txt file needed by program. 
	44 Removed frequency.txt file needed by program - arrl band chart gives same info.
	43 Changed names of some of the files for simplicity 
	42 Created a W1AW menu with the schedule and the NTS message file.
	41 Operator now called Contestant. This allows non-hams to operate with a control operator.
    	40 Contestant or Logger needs a license to enter a QSO.
    	39 "Add New Participant" window uses the Enter key to save.
	38 Can not edit previously EDITED log entries. 
2017-beta-5 (stable needs testing)
	37 Added age and official visitor entry - tracking and scoring soon. 
	36 Added participant check after an enter key for a call
	35 slowed clock slew rate and to a more odd number 
2017-beta-4 (unreleased)
	- Added "WHO" button before operator so that this can be clicked for whose on bands.
     # Determined that this is not needed now that the mouse over report is cleaner.
	- I added a mouse over pop up 
	 # but this turns out to be very annoying so it was removed.
	34 Mouse over who's on the bands report is super clean now.
	33 Fixed the output of the sections so it prints cleaner as well.
2017-beta-3 (stable needs testing)
	32 Now checks for valid sections. Thanks W6AKB
		(this was modified from 153d version of FDLog) 
2017-beta-2 (stable needs testing)
	31 Fixed the Class not updating when clicking on an HF band 
	30 Removed bug that would not allow edits if the call and band are the same.
      Now can't edit a deleted log entry, and can't edit unless it is in the log.
       -- Need to display the latest log entry if an entry has been edited previously.
	29 Removed the extra lines in the gui for the port and for the list of nodes on on each band. 
	- reverted back to the way it was for now but added the port to the header.
    Next item to work on will be the popup that will show the station on the band clicked.
2017-Beta-1
   Obviously, I never released v2015-beta-5 which is what this is.
   There were no releases in 2016, as we used the previous stable version.
   The unreleased 2015Beta4 and 2015Beta4.1 turned out to be a "time" bridge to far.
   During FD2016 one of the computers was receiving but was not sending.
   Since that computer had the time within a minute there were no conflicts with the
   database. This happens a lot, computers in and out of the network and no serious consequences. 
   Especially since we don't have more than one person on a band...
   Which made me think that there was no need for hyper-accurate time devices or synch routines. 
   So, beta 5 will revert back to a simple time master like before.
   Internet time may be kept but Internet distracts operators so our focus will be on new features.
	28 Prevented the ability to edit previously DELETED log entries. Thanks K9JAJ
	27 Adding a statement to check for uppercase. Previously unresponsive while capped locked. 
	Thanks WW9A for pointing out that the program isn't randomly freezing.
	26 Made the -Call-Class-Sect- persistently above the input line. Thanks K9MAF
	25 Added the port number to the header. Thanks K9MAF
	24 "wa6nhc 5/2013 suggests precluding site operators from being logged as Q's"
	Done. Added the ability to "dupe check" participants outside the dupe log. Thanks WA6NHC


2016 updates

SCICSG had Field Day at The Rock Church in Columbus Indiana again. We used the 
v2015 stable release again. There was discussion on using other software so 
development slowed but the group came to the conclusion that this was familiar 
and it just works. Because we used a previously stable version we were able to 
find several bugs and got several suggestions for 2017 release. Work was done to 
incorperate fdlog's time functions and operate the program over the internet but 
both were abandoned. It was decided to focus on bugs and usability. We were 5A 
with 6 operators with a lot of visitors (a lot of hams from the area) 
with 944 points. We did not turn in our results. 


2015 updates

SCICSG held field day in a field next to "The Rock" Rocky Ford Free Methodist Church 
in Columbus IN. We had 9 members in the log with many more visitors. We only used 
natural power. 6A with a total of 1644 points. 

 23 Now a Repository on Github called FDLog_Enhanced July 2015
 22 File is renamed FDLog_SCICSG.py
 21 Versions also renamed. v2015 is the first stable release on Github.
 20 Code rework from Biocca's fdlog (time functions and sql updates abandoned). 
 19 Made initialize setup routine for FD setup. 

2015_beta-3
	This is actually stable but it isn't 100% working. Now we 
	make the program work and start upgrading it.  
2015_beta-2 
	More code intigration from the original fdlog. This one
	from the beta 152i. We need to work on getting this stable. 
2015_beta_1
	Combined our stable version with the latest beta from 1-152-n.
	This includes the sql database and the fixed time function. 
	We need to get this stable and working with my enhancements.
2015_Field_Day Release 
	Code cleanup from fdlog 1-149-02


2014 updates

SCICSG held field day at CERA Land in Columbus Indiana. This was the year we 
were visited by Columbus IN Mayor Kristen Brown. We had 19 participants in the 
log but way more than that. We were 5A with 2168 points. 

 18 Project was brought into Github when Google Code closed - I forked that. 
 17 Renamed SCICSG_FDLog.py
 16 Fixed VHF to reflect a free transmitter
 15 Now warns if two vhf rigs are used
 14 Nodes now require 8 characters in length so the log lines up nicely.
 13 Added a Resources Menu Item to clean up the menu.
 12 added tildes to make the gui look nicer - input area is bigger.
 11 Additional code included from FDLog v4-1-152i


2013 updates

This is the last year we used Biocca's FDLog. After emailing Alan Biocca 
several suggestions, a possible code fix, and what seemed a "too busy" 
response to help updating the program, Scott decided to modify the program 
for himself AFTER field day 2013. It was held with the 
South Central Indiana Communications Support Group (scicsg) at CERA Land 
in Columbus Indiana. (This is the year we lost a blimp holding a wire antenna 
from a suprisingly quick storm.) The following updates were added for the next 
field day. 4A with 23 attendies, 6 computers, and 1330 points.

 10 Gui rearranged so that individual scores can be given, not just group score.
 9 Individual score displayed for the operator!
 8 Individual score displayed for the logger!  
 7 removed the text within the program to the gui menu and into another file.
 6 Can see who is on what bands with a mouse over! 
 5 .testqgen only operates with a 'tst' database.
 4 made color of the user buttons red until operator, band, power etc are assigned
 3 added and expanded the network label to explain network status.
 2 Added database protection against no band, no power, no op, and no logger
 1 Added warning against 1D to 1D contacts being logged but not counting points
 

2012 updates

Scott Hibbs KD4SIR found FDLog on the internet. Scott proposed it's use for 
field day 2012 as field day chairman of the Columbus Amateur Radio Club held 
in front of Menard's in Columbus Indiana. Columbus IN Mayor Kristen Brown visited. 
We were 3A with 1590 points. 


The following is the release log of the original fdlog:

1-149-02 2011/7/11 bug fix

    allow lowercase contest names
    add 900 mhz to editing validation
    note that report requires 4 chars in editor to save
    editor shows unvalidated fields in yellow after save attempt
    edit dialog box disappears on successful save, else stays with yellow
    fields that need fixing.
    
1-149 2011/07/02 contest set version

    adding .set contst menu for (FD,VHF)
        set global to contest type .set contst FD|VHF
        adjust dup check to call for FD, and include <call>/<grid> for VHF
    adjust bands for VHF, include 900, (drop below 6m?)
        dropping bands is tricky, leave for later.
        did add 900 band however

    setup for mercurial, opened Google Code project

1-148vf 2011/06/25 fd version

    commented out VHF code but kept other changes for 2011 fday

1-148v 2010/08/18 vhf version

    dup checking includes call/grid
    call column widened by 1 char to handle additional width
    still need to enter something in the report, such as signal strength
    fixed some small bugs in log color and editing due to dependence
    on data in the scrollbox. May be only one line change to
    make compatible with standard Field Day.

    q just needs call/grid & band (use same mode for all Qs)
    got it to work.
    added a column to make call/grid fit
    fixed a few bugs
    newline on log missing, added it, later removed again

    now two bugs. (fixed)
    local log color=blue not working
    - always black
    edit left mouse click for edit on log not working
    - probably getting error at some point and killing that thread/window
    - problem was two functions that pick up chars from msg buffer
    - adjust them by 1 char, worked

    note that python is complaining about md5 and using hashlib instead.
    snap 9, release 3 at this point

    also after space input didn't echo call with full grid. Fixed.
    converted from md5 library to hashlib. done.
    snap 10 release 4

    made call box in edit dig wider to accommodate 11 char call/grid
    added code to disallow editing another node's Qs
    after changing node id and restarting the q's still came up blue? bug?
    test code was still in. fixed.
    snap 11

    comment cleanup. added more notes detail.


1.147 2009/06/20 pre fd (used on FD 2009,2010)

    changed GOTA Q limit from 400 to 500
    demo modes commented out
    80 meter cw frequency for w1aw changed (w1aw.txt)

    qrp 5W from mains or generator has a multiplier 2 - same as 150W.
        This is not scored properly by the program yet.
    max of 20 transmitters is not enforced by the program
    educational activity is not scored by the program.
    complex GOTA bonus points are not handled by the program

1.146B has GOTA call fixed. 6/15/2008 AKB
        gcall will accept a proper call with number, somewhere prior to this
        the number part of the regex got lost. This affects log output.

1.146  2006/06/11 22:00:57  Alan Biocca
	Documentation - minor cleanup.
	Setup - added web push dir support. (also upload)
	TimeSync - new program derived from Eric's that syncs system time from GPS.

	QSO Editing! Right-clicking on a Q in the log brings up an edit
	dialog box. From there it can be Deleted, or modified and then
	Saved. Errors light up the fields in yellow when Save is attempted.
	The Dialog disappears on Successful Save, Delete, or Quit.

	Log text from the local node is blue in color, from other nodes is black.
	Automatic case adjustment for various inputs simplifies usage. Automatic
	log lookups show log entries for duplicate stations and stations being
	logged show info from other bands. Log lookups (<callsign><return>)
	conveniently allow looking stations up in the log.

	Directly Executable Version distributed. fdlogexe.zip. Runs without Python
	installed. Windows required. 3.5 Megabyte download.

1.145  2005/09/12 03:41:23  Alan Biocca
	Minor Comment Edits

New for 2005

	Time Synchronization. Designate one machine as the master, all others will
	chase it. Use '.set tmast <node>' to select master time node.

	Changed fd rules filename to 'fdrules.pdf'. Just download pdf rules and
	rename the file to this name. Then the rules can be accessed from the menu.

	Found and fixed another bug in the power type-in. Using the pulldown worked,
	but typing in caused problems. Root cause here is changes to how Python
	handles variable types.

	Made an attempt to fix up the GOTA scoring changes in the ARRL rules. Not
	tested.

	Added the second site visitor as well as the youth bonus.
	
1.144  2005/09/12 03:17:11  Alan Biocca

	prep for release to web.
	Revision log redux - Thinning.

New for 2004

	Just before Field Day many minor changes were made to the startup. The
	messages were improved and things were simplified in general. Also added
	is a directly executable version that does not require Python to be installed.
	This version carries an interpreter along with it, so it is larger.
	The startup auth key is xxxyyyzzz... xxx goes onto filename. Use 04a for
	2004 version a. yyy for port, zzz... for hash key.

	Just after Field Day the Time Sync feature was added (enough problems with
	NTP servers and clients...). Now a node may be designated as the 'time master'
	and all client FDLog programs will track it. This DOES NOT change the system
	time, just the internal time FDLog uses in the log...
	
	
1.130  2004/07/05 04:15:58  akbiocca
	Time Synch added. Clients track master node. Designate with .set tmast <node>

	Plans for time sync made. some vars defined. minor misc cleanup.

1.127  2004/06/29 15:51:13  akbiocca

	but only in the tkinter case. Perhaps a conflict with TCL? Changed my func
	to ival(). 

1.126  2004/06/28 18:42:56  akbiocca

     Initial revision (to CVS)

-------------------------------------------------------------

Program History (Pre-CVS)

Re-coding started 3/6/2002 Alan K Biocca WB6ZQZ (wb6zqz@arrl.net)
Design based on fdlog.c, by same author starting in 1984 for CP/M.

Goal: a minimum keystroke field day logging program supporting
      a group of users (a whole FD site) simultaneously

The original program was multitasking and supported multiple
stations on serial terminals, 2000 lines of small C and asm.
With help from Eric Williams WD6CMU and Steve Wilson KA6S, it
devolved to MSDOS but there supported only one user, so the
database had to be manually collated to include all stations.

Plan: use networking, usually 802.11b peer-to-peer wireless,
   to interconnect the stations. use a flood/fill algorithm
   to share data. avoid single point failure, stations can join
   and depart the network with minimal effect.

v0.01 started 3/2002. chose python as it has the features
   to do this project well and efficiently
   after 2.5 days of effort the program is working for a
   single station. useful for single station logging
