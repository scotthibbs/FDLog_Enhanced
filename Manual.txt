In a Nutshell:
	The Operator is the one making contacts.
	The Logger is the one entering data.
	One of them needs to have a license.
	If you see red, select something.
	Bands are vertical. Modes are horizontal.
	The modes are (C)ode, (D)igital, and (P)hone.
	-Call-Class-Sect- is separated by spaces. 
	An example is kd4sir 1d ky <Enter>
	Don't hit enter until after the contact is made.
	Without "QSL - May I have another?" it didn't work.
	Hit <Escape> to start over.
	Type ? for help. 


SHORT HISTORY AND INTRODUCTION: 

	This program is 33 years old!! 

	Alan K Biocca W6AKB (Formerly WB6ZQZ) Wrote this in 1984 using small c 
	and it was titled "WB6ZQZ's Field Day Logging Program". In 2002, Mr Biocca 
	rewrote the program in Python and renamed it FDLog. That year, FDLog was 
	released as open source with the GNU License. FDLog is still in use by the High Sierra 
	Field Day Group and maintained by Mr Biocca at www.fdlog.info. 

	My name is Scott Hibbs KD4SIR. I found FDLog on the internet and started using it
	for Field Day 2012. After using FDLog for Field Day 2013, the South Central Indiana 
	Communications Support Group (SCICSG - we pronounce it scuzzy) wanted to know their 
	individual scores and wanted a better way to see who was on what bands. When our 
	upgrades were not acted on, we decided to modify the program for ourselves for 2014. 
	It was eventually renamed FDLog_Enhanced and made a repository on www.github.com. 
	We have enhanced the original program and occasionally will pick up some of Mr Biocca's 
	new ideas too.  

	We hope you fall in love with the program (like we have) and can help us improve it. 

	
WHY LOVE FDLOG_ENHANCED?: 

	Simply, "It is a free networked logging program with a distributed database." If you 
	need more let me explain. Since it is networked, everyone can see the band and mode you 
	are on. Since the data is distributed, your contacts get sent to all the other users 
	in real time. No one can dupe and non-dupe contacts are displayed as you log. You can 
	send messages to all users. You can see how many contacts you have made, how many contacts
	you have logged and see the combined phone and digital contacts for the group. It tracks 
	who is the control operator (logger) for non-hams (as Operator). The GOTA station log is 
	maintained WITH the regular log without conflicting with dupes. It is simple to use. Really.

	The greatest thing is how it is not dependant on one computer! A computer can go down, bad
	crash - like Zed is dead baby - and Field Day goes on. Add a new computer to 
	the network and all the other computers will catch the new one up very quickly. 

	Because it is Python 2.7, all you need is a PC - Linux, Mac, any Windoze, RaspberryPi - 
	we don't care - doesn't matter. 
	
	Oh... Did you notice that it is HALF THE SIZE of a one page pdf file? (the ARRL Band Chart)?
	
	If I didn't HAVE you when I said, "free", "Zed is dead", and "I really don't care what 
	kind you have", maybe this program isn't for you. :)

	
PROGRAM SETUP:

	So you are the ham and or computer guru in charge of logging Field Day.. 
	Here's all you have to do. 

	Before Field Day:
	
	Find a router to bring to field day. I set the SSID to "Field Day" and
	leave it open without a password. This will be what everyone will connect
	to on field day. Test it to make sure it works. And don't leave it home. 
	I've had to buy cheap routers the morning of - I got a collection.

	Find a blank USB Flash Drive. You will need this program folder, and a 
	copy of python 2.7 from python.org for windows, mac, & linux on a flash drive.
	Python because someone will not have python installed and you may be 
	offline - without internet. Once the USB flash drive is created, copy 
	the program folder to your desktop. It is a good habit to check the time
	before starting the program, because this program can not change the 
	computer's clock. We start habits now. Check the clock. Now. 
	 
	Start FDLog_SCICSG.py. It will ask you some questions. Enter your name
	or the name of your station (others will see this) and the last two digits
	of the contest year like 17. Next it will ask if you need to set up for
	Field Day. Say yes and answer the questions. Don't worry if you don't know 
	the class or other things as this can be set later too. Importantly,
	it will ask if this computer is the time master. Select yes. Don't add 
	anything to the log that you don't want in your contest log at this point.

	At Field Day:
	
	Set up the new router because you left yours at home. Also note many
	public guest router networks will not allow computers to talk to each other. 
	Start YOUR computer (Time Master) before the others and using an accurate 
	time source - your cell phone, gps clock, atomic clock, change the time on the 
	computer to match this time source to within a second or two. Connect to
	the router network if wireless (you could also be wired). Start the 
	program. If you need to change the class or other information you added
	earlier, this can be done with the .set commands found in the help menu. 

	Next you want a copy of the program on every computer. Using the USB Flash
	Drive, copy the program folder to the desktop. Before starting the program, 
	set the time on the computer with your accurate time source within a second 
	or two. If you forget this step, the program will spend time adjusting it's 
	time to the others. Start the program and set the name and year's digits. 
	Answer NO to the setup question. If connected to the network, it should see 
	your computer and grab all it's information. Rinse and Repeat for the others.
    Make sure to allow the ports it uses through the firewall on each machine,
    or temporarily drop the firewall entirely if you're at no risk from hackers
    at the Field Day site (For instance no internet access). Ports used at one
    installation were 7373 and 7374, yours may vary.

	Before field day ends, make sure your computer is the last to be turned off. 
	This is so you have the most accurate log entries in case someone is editing 
	their log after the contest. 
	
	After Field Day:
	
	Look through the .set menu to set any missing information. Don't forget to
	use .pr to make a "fdlog.txt" file that summarizes the contacts etc. 
	Using the program's info, you can submit your results. You're a hero and 
	everyone loves ya. At the recap meeting give everyone funny certificates 
	such as most contacts, least contacts, most points, prettiest radio, 
	and the most important one - most logged which means they helped others.
	This person should be your best friend. Ask them for ideas for me. 


USING THE PROGRAM:	
	
	The Operator is the person using the radio. The Logger is the one using the
	program. The Operator or the Logger needs a license. When non-hams are using 
	a radio, they will be listed as the Operator and a ham (preferably the control 
	operator) must be listed as the Logger. Non-hams can only be listed as the 
	Logger for hams.   
	
	
LOGGING LIKE A PRO: 

	If you are seeing red, you need to select something before trying to log 
	an entry. You need to select the Operator, the Logger, the power (natural
	does not mean a gas generator), and which band and mode you will be using. 

	Entry has been straight forward since 1984. That's before pretty pictures.
	Enter the call and hit <space>. If this is a dupe it will show all the entries
	for that call and be erased. If the call has been worked on a different band 
	those will populate and the call will remain for more entry. Next enter the 
	Class and the Section. Once confirmed hit enter to add this entry to the log. 
	
	If you're feeling fancy: You can also just enter the suffix and hit space.
	It will show you those who might have been worked with that suffix on this
	band. If correct continue with the Class and Section. If incorrect type the
	correct prefix and hit space. Then continue with the call and Section. Hit
	Enter to add the call to the log.
	
	Many times the logging program will think you are getting fancy and try to be
	fancy itself. If either of you are confused, just hit Escape to clear the 
	entry and start over - try not to get too fancy. 
	

COMMANDS: 

	Adding Participants:
	
	Each participant has to have a unique set of initials. If you enter initials 
	and a name pops up you will be correcting that participant - in effect erasing
	them and adding your name. So make sure to enter a set of initials until  
	a name does not appear. 
	
	The age and visitor title are used to track official visitors and any youth 
	participants that may attend. The program doesn't automatically count these yet
	in it's summary. But one day it will. 
	
	Once you have unique initials, a name, call, age or title, simply hit enter
	to add the participant to the logbook.  

	Editing:
	
	Simply click on the entry you want to edit. In the log window the entries made 
	by this node will be dark blue while others are black. You can only edit your 
	own blue entries.  
	
	Adding Entries from a paper log:
	
	Set the operator, logger, power and band/mode then type the entry with this format. 
	:dd.hhmm <call> <report>
	
	Commands:
	
	#<message> will send a message (QST) to all the other users. 
	.st     this station's status
	.ba     station and band status
	.re     log summary report
	.pr     print contest entry to file
	.band	<space>40p<enter> will change your band to 40p. 
	.off 	Will change your band to off.
	.pow 	<space>ddddn<enter> will change your power. (ddddn could equal 100 or 1500n)
	.testq	<space><number> Will create fake number of entries in tst mode only.

	
	The .set Commands are listed in the help menu. They should be used by the person 
	setting up the program. 


TROUBLESHOOTING:

	  A new label for FDLog_Enhanced is the Network section. This label will now 
	discribe your current network status with different colors. Grey shows if everything
	is ok, Yellow will ask you if there is a problem, and Red displays if there IS a problem. 
	The messages in FDLog_Enhanced have been renamed to be more descriptive but the issues below
	are the same. 

	  NO NODE    The node identification is missing. This is necessary
				 to identify the database records when they are shared.
				 It is recommended to set this to the name of the owner
				 of the station radio or computer. THIS MUST BE UNIQUE. 
				 DO NOT GIVE TWO NODES THE SAME NODE ID at the same time. 
				 Restart the program to reset this.

	  NO AUTHKEY The authentication key is missing. Restart the program
				 and answer the query during initialization to set it.
				 It must match the other nodes you are sharing data with.
				 This is usually the last two digits of the year. 
				 
	  SNDP FAIL  The Packet Sender has received an error from the operating
				 sytem. This may occur when there is a network problem.
				 Restarting the program or rebooting may cure it.
				 
	  RCVP FAIL  In FDLog_Enhanced this is called "alone?" Ten seconds have 
				 passed without receiving any packets. This indicates that no 
				 other packets from a FDLOG program are being received within 
				 the time window. This could indicate a problem with the network 
				 or auth key, or it could be normal if this is the only computer 
				 on this network running the program. It will occur occasionally 
				 if there are only two computers on the network running FDLog. 
				 Try restarting the program after the network is known to be working.

	  AUTH FAIL  A packet has been received (on the port) that has the incorrect
				 authentication code. It will not be processed. All nodes
				 participating must use the same authentication key. Refer to
				 the command window for more information about this error. It
				 is best if test and production modes use different ports to
				 avoid seeing each others packets which have differing
				 authentication codes.

	  NEED FILL  A node status broadcast has been received, and one or more
				 of these nodes have data that this node's database does
				 not have. This node will request the missing data until
				 it is caught up. The new database items will be displayed in
				 the upper display as they come in. If the NEED FILL is
				 indicated, and no data is flowing into the upper display,
				 the requests for data are not being answered.
